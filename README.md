# GenderPredictor 🧠

A simple neural network from scratch (in Python + NumPy) that predicts gender based on weight and height.  
This project was built as a learning exercise to understand forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent **without** using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

---

## 📌 Features
- Implemented a **2 → 2 → 1** feedforward neural network from scratch.
- Uses the **sigmoid** activation function.
- Trains using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss.
- **Feature scaling** for better convergence.
- Simple classification rule:
  - ≥ 0.5 → Female
  - < 0.5 → Male

## How It Works

1. **Feature Scaling**
   ```python
   x_scaled = (x - mu) / sigma
   ```
   This centers the data around zero and reduces large value effects.

2. **Feedforward**
   - Inputs pass through **hidden layer (2 neurons)**.
   - Output neuron gives probability via sigmoid.

3. **Backpropagation**
   - Manual gradient computation using chain rule.
   - Weight & bias updates via gradient descent.

4. **Prediction**
   ```python
   if output >= 0.5:
       gender = "Female"
   else:
       gender = "Male"
   ```
